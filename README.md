# CombineFieldsIntoLongText
Project Champion - [NSerio](http://nserio.com), Relativity Script: Clients set up several choice fields where each field contains certain words, and then attorneys construct a sentence by choosing a value from each choice field. And then with the script, clients can now just run that to combine the chosen value from each of these choice fields into a single field. That single field then contains the complete sentence constructed from these fields.
